There are two types of searches implemented in this practical: tree search and graph search.
The difference between the two is that graph search keeps track of the nodes that have been
visited before.

Results for the 8-puzzle Searches:

BFTS
Generated number of nodes: 2298274
Maximum number of nodes in the frontier: 1473871

DFTS
Does not terminate because this may explore nodes which have already been explored.
This will cause the search to loop and never terminate.

BFGS
Generated number of nodes: 4359
Maximum number of nodes in the frontier: 1592

DFGS
Generated number of nodes: 34266
Maximum number of nodes in the frontier: 14480

IDTS
Generated number of nodes: 1211854
Maximum number of nodes in the frontier: 25

BFTS
Generated number of nodes: 75973
Maximum number of nodes in the frontier: 44217

DFTS
Does not terminate because this may explore nodes which have already been explored.
This will cause the search to loop and never terminate.
