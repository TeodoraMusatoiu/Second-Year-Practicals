There are two types of searches implemented in this practical:A* search using tree search and graph search.
The difference between the two is that graph search keeps track of the nodes that have been visited before.

Results for the 8-puzzle Searches:

A* Tree Search
Generated number of nodes: 964
Maximum number of nodes in the frontier: 613

A* Graph Search:
Generated number of nodes: 189
Maximum number of nodes in the frontier: 82

The values are smaller than the ones obtained in Practical 1 because A* search avoids expanding the paths which are already expensive. It uses an evaluation fnction which computes how close to the goal the respective node is. This makes A* an informed searh strategy, so it will get to the goal quicker than an uninformed one.
